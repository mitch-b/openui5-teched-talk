# XML Binding and Rapid Prototyping
### OpenUI5 SAP TechEd 2015 Proposal

OpenUI5 makes it possible for enterprises to rapidly build an interactive prototype which can help drive requirements gathering, and deliver solutions faster.

A key aspect to this rapid prototyping is XML views with their expression and model binding power.

Several points to touch on:

1. Why use XML views instead of JavaScript `(TODO: don't make this #1)`
    * Keep view logic in the view, while business logic remains in the controller
    * Fiori applications utilize XML views `(TODO: source?)`
    * Still see so many JavaScript examples online, may be that some developers are unaware that XML views exist, or how to properly use aggregations or binding in them.

1. Testing
    * Mock models can be provided to views

1. Prototyping
    * Using hard-coded JSON models allow rapid iteration of UI without worrying about simultaneously maintaining your back-end service.

1. Walk through new features of XML binding and expressions coming in 1.30 release
    * [New template schema](https://openui5beta.hana.ondemand.com/#docs/guide/5ee619fc1370463ea674ee04b65ed83b.html)
    * [Expression bindings](https://openui5beta.hana.ondemand.com/#docs/guide/daf6852a04b44d118963968a1239d2c0.html)
    * Viewing debugger output from XML expression parser

1. What's so great about XML views?
    * Declarative, easy to read
    * Pass in models to multiple re-usable fragments in the same view
        * `<template:with />`
        * Demo
    * Security binding on a User model
        * Enabled/Visible
        * Demo
    * Simulating multiple user experiences with unique usage of *one-time* binding syntax
        * Demo


1. Extras!

    * How to use jsbin (relate to DJ Adamsâ€™ minimum-viable-code example, and create ones with sample models in them)
